    <h2>&quot;Digital Dog&quot;</h2>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s such a fucked up thing to say, Clark.&quot; Well, it was true. Specks of pollen traced the folds of Nita&#39;s eyelids as she rolled off her belly from the grass. This had been going on for months- the meetings, the conversations, the apathetic air which tended to accompany their reunions of overstated importance. It was difficult for him to focus on her pouted lower lip. Their murmured conversation drowned in the raucous sea of inanities spilling from the mouth of a nearby stranger. The woman had legs that appeared much too long for her surprisingly condensed torso, a feature further intensified by her posture- forward bent, eyes boring into the screen of her iPhone 7 Plus. Her device proudly boasted physical dimensions resemblant of an overgrown Chase Sapphire card-standing at 158.2 millimeters, 77.9 millimeters in width, and slimmed to a mere 7.3 millimeters in thickness, the one-hundred and eighty-eight-gram telephone was nothing short of modern man&#39;s greatest fantasy. She moaned with uninhibited pleasure at her Facebook friend Jill&#39;s &quot;outrageous&quot; new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Cody; it was far cuter than one could possibly imagine. 
</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; There was no menace in her tone, more so an air of resignation. His response was lost to distracting thoughts. Imagine the amount of porn you could store on that new model. Clark wasn&#39;t quite sure how much storage space an average user-submitted porn video occupied, but he let his imagination allow approximately 1.3-1.7 gigabytes of space per film. It had been on his mind lately, that is, the benefit of a twenty-eight-minute film complete with context, foreplay, hardcore penetration, a cum shot, and a neat conclusion. At which point did his arousal escalate to blood-flow and the consequent, immediate ejaculation? Was the context really essential to that experience? Could he become one of those people that attained satisfaction from a thirty-seven second clip? 
</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed Nita&#39;s gaze had softened from its hardened state to match her tone. Her eyelids were nearly shut, and her lips faintly upturned, an expression eerily similar to that of Marat&#39;s in Jacques-Louis David&#39;s depiction of the Swiss-born politician&#39;s assassination. However, she was no revolutionary, and he, certainly no assassin. In fact, the fields of emotion they&#39;d traversed for the past three years were as tiresome and common as the southeast Asian backpacking routes explored by newly invigorated gap-year students, hungry for existential substance in their dwindling teenage years. Clark knew firsthand that waist-deep submersion in third-world nations led neither to individualistic discovery nor to a greater development of humanistic empathy. Rather, such experiences allowed caustic sentiments (often verging on racism) about &quot;foreign culture&quot; to linger at the tip of his tongue, usually swallowed with the rest of his thoughts, halting their transformation to utterance. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark hesitated before raising his head, allowing his eyes to meet Nita&#39;s. &quot;It&#39;s just that&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;. His voice trailed off, Nita&#39;s faded green irises now glistened beneath droplets of tears. He stared into them, surprised at how clearly he could see his own reflection between her wetted blinks. To him, his facial expression-one of increasing familiarity, betrayed a delicate balance of earnest concern and physical exhaustion.  He wondered if she read otherwise. His extended pause in speech had apparently caused her alarm. She stood. The woman on her iPhone raised her head long enough to cast a shifty-eyed glance before assuming a gaze of feigned preoccupation. Clark opened his mouth before realizing he had little, if not a thing to say to the now distanced Nita receding further into the landscape-a Constable-esque blemish on the vast horizon.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was more than a year ago, thought Clark, nearly dropping his MacBook as he clambered onto his stained and unmade twin-sized mattress. As the computer booted, its processor purred, delivering a warm vibration atop his bare, pale thighs. He opened a minimized tab and was met with the image of a room more familiar to him than his own. Slumping back against his poplar headboard, he submitted to an overwhelming wave of paralysis. It was then that she, and a stranger, entered the frame. Clark could do nothing, but observe.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue undressing in the shadowy comfort of your monitor&#39;s pale blue light. Stare at yet another man you are not quite attracted to, but not enough so to say &quot;leave.&quot; Glance at nearly every object in your room as the unfamiliar mound of muscles and flesh beckons you from atop your own mattress. Let your eyes graze the white-painted furniture you insisted would contribute a &quot;beachy atmosphere&quot; to your sagging apartment, located one hundred and seventy-three miles from the elusive coastline. The black straps of your bra catch on your bony elbows as your newfound acquaintance impatiently tugs it towards your waist. You begin to try explaining that bras shouldn&#39;t be removed in such a manner but are distracted by the lingering image of seawater, ebbing and flowing in your mind. His fingers tear your underwear from your seated hips. You begin to grow concerned about his lack of care for your undergarments, of which he probably is unaware, are quite expensive. Your back arches and your shoulders slump forward. With each increasingly shorter pant, I lose interest.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he gently closes the lid of his laptop, they climax in unison. The image distorts with the fold of the screen, and from the crackling speakers emerges the faintest of utterances, &quot;you&#39;ll never feel like you do with me.&quot;</p>
